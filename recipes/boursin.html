    <h3>This is a quick and easy side pasta dish with only 3 ingredients! Add a protein like grilled chicken 
        breast to turn it from a tasty side dish to a main course—or it can be a vegetarian main.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>1 (5.2 ounce) package garlic and herb cheese spread (such as Boursin®)</li>
        <li>¾ cup grape tomatoes, sliced (Optional)</li>
        <li>chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ cup reserved pasta water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta, reserving 3/4 cup water ( you may not need it all).</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 cup reserved water into sauce pan. Add Boursin cheese, whisking to combine until smooth. Add tomatoes and cook, no longer than 2 minutes. Add pasta back into the sauce. Garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
